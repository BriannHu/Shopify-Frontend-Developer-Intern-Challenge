# Submission for Shopify's Frontend Challenge

### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

This is my submission for Shopify's Summer 2022 Frontend Developer Intern challenge, using NASA's APOD (A Picture A Day) endpoint.

The core features include:
- Fetching data from the APOD endpoint and displaying the images (in grid form)
- Showing descriptive data for each image (credits for each image can be seen by hovering over the info icon)
- Liking/unliking an image - either by clicking on the heart or the image itself

It also includes:
- A calendar to select different start dates
- An instagram-esque animation for liking
- A loading state while the data is being fetched
- Dark mode!
- Using local storage to save the likes/selected start date/selected light or dark mode
